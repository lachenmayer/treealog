When I land on treealog
I want to be able to create a conversation
So that I can have a conversation

When I land on treealog
I want to see all the conversations I'm part of
So that I can check out existing conversations

When I'm looking for content to check out
I want to see which of my conversations have been updated since I last checked
So that I can see new stuff

When I'm in a conversation
I want to be able to add a response to any uttering
So that I can respond to that particular uttering

When I'm looking at a conversation that I'm not part of
I want to be able to add a response to any uttering
So that I can respond to that particular uttering
(response will not be seen by anyone else at this point...)

When I've created a response in a conversation that I'm not part of
I want to be notified that the conversation owner needs to add me to the conversation for them to see it
So that I don't assume that my response will be seen by the people in the conversation

When there aren't enough people (ie. none...) in my conversation
I want to add participants to the conversation
So that I can talk with others
(this will only work if you are the conversation owner)

When I am in a conversation
I want to see who is participating in that conversation
So I know who's in it

When I am in a conversation
I want to see the seeding status for all the participants
So I can figure out if some content is missing & tell the participant that they need to seed their stuff
